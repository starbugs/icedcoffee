/**
 @brief Base class for drawable nodes in a scene
 
 The ICNode class represents a low-level drawable object which is capable of receiving user
 interaction events from the framework. Each node provides an array of strong references to its
 children nodes and a weak reference to its parent node. A collection of linked nodes forms a
 tree-like structure, called a scene graph. A scene graph must be rooted in an ICScene object
 in order to exploit all capabilities of the framework.
 
 A node has a transform matrix used to transform coordinates from parent space to its own
 local space. Nodes provide convenience methods for manipulating their transform matrix based
 on ICNode::position, ICNode::scale, rotation (ICNode::getRotationAngle:axis:,
 ICNode::setRotationAngle:axis:) and ICNode::anchorPoint properties. Furthermore, nodes provide
 methods for calculating inverse and world transforms.
 
 Visitors are used to traverse a given scene graph for drawing on a framebuffer. A visitor is
 an external object of class ICNodeVisitor. The framework ships with two built-in visitor classes,
 ICNodeVisitorDrawing for drawing nodes on screen and ICNodeVisitorPicking for drawing nodes
 on an invisible framebuffer for picking.
 
 Since icedcoffee is based on GLES2, each node uses shader programs for drawing. Shader programs
 are managed using the ICShaderProgram and ICShaderCache classes.
 
 Nodes provide the basis for user interaction event handling for mice, touch, and keyboard
 devices. Event handling is implemented on top of the scene graph in the ICScene, ICResponder, and
 ICHostViewController classes amongst others.
 
 ### Subclassing ###
 
 ICNode may be subclassed to implement custom nodes. Most likely, you will want to implement
 custom drawing and/or custom event handling (based on ICResponder.)
 
 #### Custom Drawing ####
 
  - ICNode's designated initializer is ICNode::init. You should override ICNode::init
    to implement custom initialization on top of ICNode.
  - Set a custom shader program in the subclasses' initializer if necessary.
  - ICNode::drawWithVisitor: is called by the framework when the node needs to be drawn into
    a framebuffer. It is used for both drawing and picking.
  - When you override ICNode::drawWithVisitor:, first check whether the node is visible and
    skip any drawing if it is not.
  - icedcoffee does by default provide two different visitors. ICNodeVisitorDrawing is
    used for rendering objects on screen while ICNodeVisitorPicking is used to draw objects
    on an internal picking framebuffer. ICNode provides a standard way of setting up shaders
    for drawing and picking. Hence, after checking for visibility, you should call
    ICNode::applyStandardDrawSetupWithVisitor: . This will automatically activate the node's shader
    program for drawing or the default picker shader program for picking.
  - You may implement custom picking shapes or optimized drawing code for picking by checking
    the class of the visitor object given when ICNode::drawWithVisitor: is called. If visitor is
    kind of class ICNodeVisitorDrawing, provide code to draw the object's visible shape on screen.
    If visitor is kind of class ICNodeVisitorPicking, provide code to draw the object's
    pickable shape.
  - You may also implement your drawing code without taking care of picking. In this
    case the framework will automatically use the object's drawn shape as a picking shape
    provided that you employ ICNode::applyStandardDrawSetupWithVisitor: to set up drawing.
 
 #### Custom Event Handling ####
 
  - Event handling is based on the ICResponder super class. You implement event handlers
    by overriding one of the event handler methods defined there, e.g. by implementing
    ICResponder::mouseDown:. You may override both touch and mouse event handler methods in one
    ICNode subclass. On Mac OS X the node will receive mouse events and on iOS it will receive
    touch events.
  - By default, events received but not handled by your node will be passed on to the next
    responder in the responder chain. The next responder is by default set to the parent of the
    node. You may choose to override this default by implementing ICNode::init and setting
    ICResponder::nextResponder to some other object. You may suppress event forwarding by
    implementing the respective event handler with an empty body in your subclass. If you
    implement a certain event handler method for performing a specific task, you may choose to
    pass the event to the next responder by calling the respective event method on
    <code>self.nextResponder</code> at the end of your method implementation.

 @brief The rectangle occupied by the receiver on its parent scene's framebuffer
 
 This method calculates the origin and size of the rectangle occupied by the node on its parent
 scene's framebuffer. The rectangle is always aligned to the framebuffer's axes. All coordinates
 are expressed in points rather than pixels.

 @remarks The calculations performed by this method are based on the ICNode::position and
 ICNode::size properties. For this method to work correctly, the following preconditions
 must be met:
 - The receiver's ICNode::size property must be set correctly, that is, covering
   the whole (cubic) space occupied by the receiver's visible contents.
 - The receiver must have been added to a valid ICScene object before this method is
   called.
 - The parent scene of the receiver must have a valid target framebuffer.
 
 @return Returns a ``CGRect`` defining the rectangle (in points) occupied by the node's visible
 contents. If the method fails to calculate the node's frame rect, a zero ``CGRect`` is returned.
 When this happens, most likely one or many of the preconditions outlined above have not been met.

 This method is called by the framework to draw the receiver using a visitor. You should

 You should override this method in drawable node subclasses to implement your custom drawing code.

 method.
 
 Example:
 @code
 - (void)drawWithVisitor:(ICNodeVisitor *)visitor
 {
    [self applyStandardDrawSetupWithVisitor:visitor];
 
    // Your custom drawing code goes here
 }
 @endcode
 
 @note If necessary, you should implement a specialized drawing setup for picking. You may do
 so by checking whether the specified visitor is kind of class ICNodeVisitorPicking. If so,
 you may want to deactivate texturing to improve performance or to provide custom picking shapes
 for clicks, mouse overs, and touches.

 is a descendant of an ICRenderTexture's ICRenderTexture::subScene and the render texture's
 ICRenderTexture::frameUpdateMode is set to ICFrameUpdateModeOnDemand, then you have to call
 this method to ensure that the render texture's contents are redrawn to reflect a change
 in the appearance of the receiver. Likewise, if the receiver's ICNode::hostViewController's
 ICHostViewController::frameUpdateMode is set to ICFrameUpdateModeOnDemand, this method needs
 to be called so that the whole scene is redrawn on the host view controller's view.
 
 Note that this method does not actually redraw the receiver. Instead, it informs the framework
 to redraw the content's of the receiver's parent frame buffer the next time it enters the
 ICHostViewController::drawScene or ICRenderTexture::drawWithVisitor: method.

 receive user interaction events to improve performance. If you subclass ICNode, you may
 disable user interaction by default by overriding ICNode::init.
 
 @note Even if ICNode::userInteractionEnabled is set to NO, the node may still receive events
 indirectly as a result of the responder chain implemented in icedcoffee's event processing
 system. The default ICResponder implementation will forward events to the next responder if they
 are not handled by the node itself. Event forwarding as part of the responder chain is not
 influenced by the ICNode::userInteractionEnabled property.
