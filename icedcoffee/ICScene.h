/**
 @brief Defines the root of a scene graph, manages a camera and visitors for drawing nodes
 
 <h3>Overview</h3>
 
 The ICScene class defines a node that acts as the root of a scene graph by providing
 functionality that allows you to easily draw the scene's contents to a framebuffer.
 
 In particular, ICScene fulfills the following tasks:
 <ul>
    <li>Managing a scene camera (see ICCamera) that takes care of setting up the scene's
    projection and model-view matrices for presentation.</lI>
    <li>Setting up the scene's OpenGL states for drawing and picking.</li>
    <li>Managing visitors that are responsible for drawing and picking the
    scene's contents.</li>
    <li>Performing hit tests on the scene conveniently.</li>
    <li>Intelligently resizing the scene when its parent framebuffer size changes.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3>Root Scenes</h3>

 Scenes play a central role in the icedcoffee framework. In order to benefit from icedcoffee's
 event handling and user interface rendering capabilities, your application must provide at least
 one scene, called the root scene. The root scene represents the origin of all contents that
 are drawn on the OpenGL framebuffer of the host view that is managed by your application's
 host view controller (see ICHostViewController).
  
 <h3>Setting up a Root Scene</h3>
 
 You set up a root scene with a default camera by initializing ICScene using ICScene::init
 or ICScene::scene. You then define the scene's contents by adding nodes to it using
 ICNode::addChild:. Finally, as your scene is supposed to be the root scene of a host
 view in your application, you hand it to that host view controller using
 ICHostViewController::runWithScene:.
 
 <h3>Sub Scenes</h3>
 
 In addition to the root scene, you may add further scenes to your existing scene graph.
 However, when doing so, you should take care of the following conventions:
 <ol>
    <li>Scenes may be added as an immediate child of another scene. In this case, the sub
    scene inherits the framebuffer target of the parent scene and uses the parent scene's
    visitors to perform drawing and picking. Hit tests should always be performed on the
    parent scene in this scenario. Nesting scenes directly in each other may be useful to
    animate the camera of the sub scene without influencing the appearance of the nodes
    rendered by the parent scene, for instance.</li>
    <li>Scenes may be used by ICRenderTexture to present sub scenes on a framebuffer backed
    by a render texture. It is important to note that such sub scenes are not part of the
    scene graph's node hierarchy as ICRenderTexture disconnects them from the normal drawing
    mechanism of its parent scene. Instead these scenes act as the root scene of the
    render texture's framebuffer.</li>
    <li>Scenes may be added as immediate children of an ICView instance. This can be used
    to present a scene's contents in a user interface view with built-in clipping and
    layouting functionality. However, special rules apply for this kind of scene nesting.
    The nested scene will always have the size of the parent framebuffer. If the view is
    not backed by a render texture, this is the size of the host view's framebuffer.
    Consequently, the scene's children live in world coordinate space. If the so-nested
    scene's contents should be aligned to the parent view's origin on screen, you must
    perform the necessary transformations yourself. What is more, scenes nested this way
    may interfere with the parent view's clipping mechanism if they clear the stencil
    buffer. You should thus deactivate automatic stencil buffer clearing by setting the
    ICScene::clearsStencilBuffer property to <code>NO</code> for such kind of sub scenes.
 </ol>
 
 <h3>Setting up a Sub Scene</h3>
 
 You set up a sub scene exactly the way you set up a root scene, as described in "Setting
 up a Root Scene". The only difference is that you add the scene as a child of another node
 or set it as the ICRenderTexture::subScene property of a render texture.
 
 <h3>Scene Sizes and The Relation of Scenes to Framebuffers</h3>
 
 Newly initialized scenes have zero size until they are added to an existing scene graph
 or assigned to a host view controller. If you need a valid size for the scene in order to set
 up its contents, you should add it to your existing scene graph or assign it to a host view
 controller immediately after initialization.
 
 When a root scene is assigned to a host view controller, it immediately resizes itself so as
 to fit the size of the host view's OpenGL framebuffer in points.
 
 When a sub scene is added to an existing scene or set as the sub scene of a render texture,
 it immediately resizes itself to fit the size of its parent framebuffer. The parent frame
 buffer of a scene is defined by its first ancestor defining a render target, or, if no such
 node exists, the host view controller.
 
 When a scene is resized (explicitly or implicitly), it attempts to resize its descendant
 scenes to its own size, following the third convention described in "Sub Scenes". This does,
 however, not have an effect on descendant render texture sub scenes, since these are
 disconnected from the drawing mechanism of their parent scenes as discussed above.
 
 <h3>Standard Scenes (ICScene) versus User Interface Scenes (ICUIScene)</h3>
 
 Along with the standard scene implemented in the ICScene class, Icedcoffe provides a
 special subclass that is designed to host user interfaces, named ICUIScene. ICUIScene
 essentially provides a content view (ICView) child whose size is synchronized automatically
 with the UI scene's size. This allows for automatic resizing and layouting of the content
 view's subviews. See the ICUIScene documentation for more details.
 
 <h3>Subclassing</h3>
 
 You may subclass ICScene to create scenes with custom behavior and/or content. If you
 wish to implement a custom user interface scene, you should consider subclassing ICUIScene
 instead.

 Generally, the following points should be respected when subclassing ICScene:
 
 <ol>
    <li>ICScene's designated initializer is ICScene::initWithCamera:. You may override
    it to implement custom initialization. You may also set up predefined scene
    content in ICScene::initWithCamera:. However, remember that ICScene is initialized with zero
    size, so automatic positioning behaviors, implemented in e.g. ICNode::centerNode, will
    not work unless you define a size on your own.</li>
    <li>ICScene overrides ICNode::drawWithVisitor: to set up the scene for drawing or
    picking according to the type of the visitor that calls the method. Thus, you should
    call <code>[super drawWithVisitor:visitor]</code> if you override <code>drawWithVisitor:</code>
    in your subclass <i>before</i> performing any drawing operation. Likewise, if you override
    ICScene::childrenDidDrawWithVisitor:, you should call
    <code>[super childrenDidDrawWithVisitor:visitor];</code> <i>after</i> your custom code.</li>
    <li>If you need to customize scene setup and tear down you may override
    ICScene::setUpSceneForDrawingWithVisitor:, ICScene::tearDownSceneAfterDrawingWithVisitor:,
    ICScene::setUpSceneForPickingWithVisitor:, and ICScene::tearDownSceneAfterPickingWithVisitor:.</li>
    <li>ICScene overrides ICNode::setParent: in order to adjust its size to the parent
    framebuffer's size. If you override, setParent: call <code>[super setParent:parent]</code>
    before implementing your own code.</li>
    <li>ICScene overrides ICNode::setSize: to adjust its camera's viewport and resize
    descendant scenes. You need to call <code>[super setSize:size]</code> to preserve
    this behavior.</li>
 </ol>
