/**
 @brief Represents an immutable two-dimensional OpenGL texture
 
 The ICTexture2D class provides methods allowing you to conveniently create and work with
 immutable two-dimensional OpenGL textures. In particular, ICTexture2D provides the following
 features:
 
 - Create textures from arbitrary pixel data, ``CGImage``s and from text strings
 - Manage the size of a texture with respect to SD and HD images and display devices
 - Set texture parameters for texture filtering on the OpenGL state
 
 The most common use case in most applications is loading a texture from a file. However,
 this is not directly supported by ICTexture2D. The ICTextureLoader class provides many methods
 that allow you to easily load textures from image files. The ICTextureCache class adds
 functionality to asynchronously load and cache textures in your application.

 @brief Initializes a texture with the given data, pixel format, size and resolution type

 @param textureSizeInPixels The size of the texture in pixels
 @param contentSizeInPixels The size of the texture's contents in pixels
 @param resolutionType An ``ICResolutionType`` enumerated value defining the texture's
 resolution type
 
 The given ``data`` must contain pixels formatted as defined by the specified ``pixelFormat``.
 The most common pixel format in icedcoffee is ``ICPixelFormatRGBA8888``.
  ``textureSizeInPixels`` may differ from ``contentSizeInPixels`` in cases where power of two
 textures must be used to store non-power of two (NPOT) contents. The former defines the size of
 the texture in memory whereas the latter defines the size of the content stored in the texture.
  The ``resolutionType`` argument specifies the native resolution of the texture. If the texture
 represents a high resolution (retina display) image, you should set this to
 ``ICResolutionTypeRetinaDisplay``. Otherwise, this should be set to ``ICResolutionTypeStandard``.
 
 Note that this method calls ICTexture2D::setAntiAliasTexParameters before uploading the texture
 and that it binds the texture to ``GL_TEXTURE_2D`` on the current OpenGL context.
