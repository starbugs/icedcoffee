/**
 @brief Provides texture caching and management
 
 The ICTextureCache class provides mechanisms to load, cache and release textures conveniently.
 
 Icedcoffee sets up one default texture cache for each OpenGL context controlled by the framework.
 You may retrieve the texture cache for the current OpenGL context using the
 ICTextureCache::currentTextureCache class method. Due to this mechanism, there usually is no need
 to instanciate a texture cache on your own.
 
 ### Using the Texture Cache ###
 
 The texture cache provides methods for loading textures synchronously and asynchronously. Once
 a texture is loaded, it is automatically cached in memory. When another component loads the same
 texture at a later time, the texture cache ensures that the cached texture is delivered without
 reloading it from its source medium.
 
 You may load textures from local files synchronously using the
 ICTextureCache::loadTextureFromFile:resolutionType: method. If you wish to load textures
 from local files in the background, you may use
 ICTextureCache::loadTextureFromFileAsync:resolutionType:withTarget:withObject:.
 
 If you need to unload a texture for a certain path or URL, use
 ICTextureCache::removeTextureForKey:. If you wish to remove all unused textures from the cache,
 call ICTextureCache::removeUnusedTextures. If you need to remove all textures from the cache,
 call ICTextureCache::removeAllTextures:. Removing a texture from the cache does not mean it is
 necessarily unloaded from memory. To make sure a texture's memory is freed, you must remove all
 references to that texture.
