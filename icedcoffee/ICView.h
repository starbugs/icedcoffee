/**
 @brief Represents a user interface view

 The ICView class implements the fundamental functionality of user interface views in the
 icedcoffee framework. Like all other drawable elements in icedcoffee, ICView is based on
 the ICNode class. It adds functionality that is commonly required when building visual user
 interface elements, such as clipping, buffering and layouting contents.
 
 The following is a list of the most notable features introduced by the ICView class:
 
 - Buffering a view's contents in a rectangular area using a render texture backing
 - Clipping the view's children both in normal and in buffer backed mode
 - Providing an interface for layouting the view's children
 - Providing a system to autoresize views based on autoresizing masks
 - Allowing you to conveniently draw a 2D background based on ICSprite
  
 ### Setup ###
 
 A view must be initialized with a predefined size using the ICView::initWithSize: method.
 After initialization, you define the contents of the view by adding children to it using
 the ICView::addChild: method.
 
 By default, freshly initialized views will have no render texture backing. If your view
 requires such backing, send it an ICView::setWantsRenderTextureBacking: message specifying
 ``YES`` for the ``wantsRenderTextureBacking`` argument. The view will then automatically
 create a render texture along with a corresponding sub scene and reorganize its contents
 so as to draw its children to the backing render texture FBO. Backings generated using
 ICView::setWantsRenderTextureBacking: are simple ICRenderTexture nodes providing a color
 buffer and a stencil buffer. If you need a backing with more capabilities, you may create
 it on your own and set it on the view using the ICView::backing property.
 
 If a view uses a render texture backing, it will automatically clip its children to 
 its backing's bounds. Otherwise, the view will not clip its children unless you
 explicitly set ICView::clipsChildren to ``YES``. Unbacked views clip their
 children using stencil masks. Hence, the FBO the view is rendered to must provide a
 stencil buffer. If no stencil buffer is present, no clipping will occur.
 
 ### Subclassing ###
 
 You should subclass ICView to implement classes representing user interface views.
 The following points should be considered when subclassing the ICView class:

 - ICView's designated initializer is ICView::initWithSize:. If you need to implement
   custom initialization logic, override this method instead of ICNode::init.
 - As mentioned before, ICView allows for buffered rendering using a render texture
   backing. When ICView::backing is set, ICView automatically moves its children to the
   backing's sub scene. However, since ICView overrides all methods related to scene graph
   composition, its children still appear as its own children to the outside. Usually,
   you do not have to care about this explicitly, but there are exceptions to that rule.
   Just in case, keep in mind that ICView::addChild:, ICView::insertChild:atIndex:,
   ICView::removeChild:, ICView::removeChildAtIndex:, ICView::removeAllChildren, and
   ICView::children are overriden by ICView.
 - As ICView may operate in buffer backed mode, you need to call ICNode::setNeedsDisplay
   if a descendant node changes its appearance. Calling ICView::setNeedsDisplay on ICView
   also marks the view's contents for redrawing.
 - You may implement custom layouting by overriding the ICView::layoutChildren method.
