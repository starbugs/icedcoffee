/**
 @brief Implements an animation timing function
 
 The ICAnimationTimingFunction class implements an animation timing function based on a cubic
 bezier curve, where the X axis is the time axis and the Y axis represents animation progression.
 The timing function transforms input time factors ``x`` in range [0,1] to output time factors
 ``y``, also in range [0,1], by computing the point at the given ``x`` coordinate on the curve
 and returning its ``y`` coordinate value (see the ICAnimationTimingFunction::transform: method).
 
 The function's bezier curve is defined by points (0,0), ICAnimationTimingFunction::c0,
 ICAnimationTimingFunction::c1, and (1,1). The start and end points of the curve cannot be changed.
 
 You may create a custom animation timing function using the
 ICAnimationTimingFunction::timingFunctionWithControlPointsC0:c1: method. Additionally, there are
 a couple of convenience methods to create common predefined timing functions such as
 ICAnimationTimingFunction::linearTimingFunction, ICAnimationTimingFunction::easeInTimingFunction
 or ICAnimationTimingFunction::easeOutTimingFunction.
