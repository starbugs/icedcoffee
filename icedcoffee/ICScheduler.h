 @brief A scheduler used for continuously updating animated objects in a scene
 
 A scheduler continuously updates registered objects for animation purposes. 
 Schedulers work in collaboration with host view controllers to issue pending updates to
 registered objects.
 
 Note that ICScheduler updates will only work as expected if the host view
 controller's ICHostViewController:frameUpdateMode is set to ICFrameUpdateModeSynchronized.
 Scenes usnig host view controllers that update their host view frame on demand should
 use NSTimer to perform updates.
