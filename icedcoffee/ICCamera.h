/**
 @brief Camera base class providing standard 3D projection and model-view transforms
 
 This class implements a basic camera performing OpenGL projection and model-view transforms
 based on a number of parameters specified by the user:
 
 <ul>
    <li><b><code>eye:</code></b> A 3D vector defining the position of the camera's eye</li>
    <li><b><code>lookAt:</code></b> A 3D vector defining the position of the point the camera
    should look at</li>
    <li><b><code>upVector:</code></b> A 3D vector defining the up direction</li>
    <li><b><code>fov:</code></b> The field of view angle of the camera, in degrees</li>
    <li><b><code>aspect:</code></b> The aspect ratio of the camera's frustum</li>
    <li><b><code>zNear:</code></b> The distance of the near plane to the camera's eye</li>
    <li><b><code>zFar:</code></b> The distance of the far plane to the camera's eye</li>
 </ul>
 
 For the settings to take effect, a camera must be applied to the OpenGL scene using the
 ICCamera::apply method. Cameras have a caching mechanism for their internal projection and
 look-at matrices. Whenever a parameter is changed, the look-at and/or projection matrices
 will be recalculated the next time ICCamera::apply is called.
 
 ###Setup###

 ICCamera should be initialized using the
 ICCamera::initWithEye:lookAt:upVector:fov:aspect:zNear:zFar:viewport: method. The ICScene
 class by default creates an ICUICamera camera object for you. If
 you need a different camera, instanciate your own ICCamera object and initialize ICScene
 using ICScene::initWithHostViewController:camera:.
 
 ###Subclassing###
 
 The ICCamera class may be used as a base class for specialized camera classes. The designated
 initializer for ICCamera is ICCamera::initWithEye:lookAt:upVector:fov:aspect:zNear:zFar:viewport:
 for generic cameras or ICCamera::initWithViewport: for cameras setting up projection and look-at
 based on internal computations. The framework will always call ICCamera::initWithViewport: to
 initialize newly created cameras.
 
 If you add properties that may have an effect on the internal transform matrix calculations
 of ICCamera, you must call <code>setDirty:YES</code> in your property setter. You may also have
 to override the ICCamera::setUpScreen method to implement custom transformations.
