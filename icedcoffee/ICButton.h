/**
 @brief Represents a button control

 <h3>Overview</h3>
 
 The ICButton class defines a flexible button control comprised of a background view and a title
 label. The class allows you to define different custom backgrounds for each control state (normal,
 pressed, disabled, highlighted, selected). By default, ICButton uses a built-in shader based
 rounded rectangle view to draw its background.
 
 <h3>Setup</h3>
 
 You initialize a new button using the ICButton::initWithSize: method. Alternatevily, you may use
 the ICButton::buttonWithSize: convenience method, which returns a new autoreleased button.
 After initializing a button, you will most likely want to set its title. The following example
 code illustrates how to create a button with a custom title:
 
 @code
 // Create a new autoreleased ICButtton object
 ICButton *myButton = [ICButton buttonWithSize:kmVec2Make(160,21,0)];
 // Set the title of the button to some custom string
 myButton.label.text = @"My Button Title";
 // Add the button to our scene (assuming that scene is a valid ICScene object)
 [scene addChild:myButton];
 @endcode
