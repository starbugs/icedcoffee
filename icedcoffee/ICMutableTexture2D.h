/**
 @brief Represents a mutable two-dimensional texture
 
 ICMutableTexture2D represents a mutable two-dimensional texture. It is based upon ICTexture2D
 and adds the following functionality:
 - Initializing a texture without immediately uploading its contents to OpenGL video memory
 - Keeping a copy of a texture's data in RAM
 - Uploading modified texture data to OpenGL at any time
 - Updating a rectangular area of a texture at any time
 */
@interface ICMutableTexture2D : ICTexture2D {
@protected
    void *_data;
    BOOL _ownsData;
    BOOL _dataDirty;
}

/**
 @brief Initializes a mutable texture
 
 @param data A buffer containing the data to be uploaded to the OpenGL texture. You may specify
 ``nil`` if the texture's data should not be uploaded immediately.
 @param pixelFormat An ``ICPixelFormat`` enumerated value defining the texture's pixel format
 @param textureSizeInPixels The size of the texture in pixels
 @param contentSizeInPixels The size of the texture's contents in pixels
 @param resolutionType An ``ICResolutionType`` enumerated value defining the texture's
 resolution type
 @param keepData A boolean flag indicating whether the given data should be kept in memory.
 If set to ``YES``, ICMutableTexture2D will claim ownership the memory pointed to by ``data``
 by referencing it in ICMutableTextur2D::data and setting ICMutableTexture2D::ownsData to ``YES``.
 This will free the block of memory pointed to be ``data`` implicitly upon deallocation.
 @param uploadImmediately A boolean flag indicating whether the given ``data`` should be uploaded
 to OpenGL video memory immediately upon initialization. If set to ``NO``, ICMutableTexture2D
 will neither create an OpenGL texture name nor upload any texture data before
 ICMutableTexture2D::upload is called.
 
 The given ``data`` must contain pixels formatted as defined by the specified ``pixelFormat``.
 The most common pixel format in icedcoffee is ``ICPixelFormatRGBA8888``.
 ``textureSizeInPixels`` may differ from ``contentSizeInPixels`` in cases where power of two
 textures must be used to store non-power of two (NPOT) contents. The former defines the size of
 the texture in memory whereas the latter defines the size of the content stored in the texture.
 The ``resolutionType`` argument specifies the native resolution of the texture. If the texture
 represents a high resolution (retina display) image, you should set this to
 ``ICResolutionTypeRetinaDisplay``. Otherwise, this should be set to ``ICResolutionTypeStandard``.
 
 Note that this method calls ICTexture2D::setAntiAliasTexParameters before uploading the texture
 and that it binds the texture to ``GL_TEXTURE_2D`` on the current OpenGL context.
