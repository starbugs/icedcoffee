/**
 @brief A colored and textured 2D sprite
 
 ICSprite defines a rectangular quad (icQuad) which may be drawn in an arbitrary 3D scene.
 The quad consists of two polygons and is rendered as a static triangle strip.
 You may set a color and a texture which is used to render the quad's fragments.
 The quad's size is by default set to the size of the texture (in points.) If no
 texture is set, the quad's size defaults to (w=1,h=1).
