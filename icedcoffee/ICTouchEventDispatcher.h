/**
 @brief Multitouch event dispatcher for iOS
 
 ICTouchEventDispatcher dispatches incoming touches to ICNode objects in an icedcoffee scene.
 ICNode objects receive corresponding ICResponder::touchesBegan:withTouchEvent:,
 ICResponder::touchesMoved:withTouchEvent:, ICResponder::touchesEnded:withTouchEvent:, and
 ICResponder::touchesCancelled:withTouchEvent: messages.
 
 Touch dispatch is performed conforming to the following rules:
 
    * When the dispatcher receives a touchesBegan:withEvent: message, for each individual touch,
      it computes the touches' dispatch target by performing a hit test, then internally caches
      the touch-dispatch target pair in a dictionary.
    * When a touchesMoved:withEvent: message is received, the dispatcher filters the previously
      cached touches with the incoming touches and dispatches the resulting touches to the
      dispatch targets computed in the previous phase.
    * When a touchesEnded:withEvent: or touchesCancelled:withEvent: message is received, the
      dispatcher first performs the same action as described in the previous point, then
      removes the incoming touches from the cache.
 
 The behavior implemented here is similar to that of the UIKit dispatcher. That is, before
 ICResponder::touchesBegan:withTouchEvent: is dispatched, the framework computes the dispatch
 targets for the incoming touches. In the following touch phases, the dispatch targets doesn't
 change. In other words, the object on which a given touch began continuously receives events
 for that touch until the user releases her corresponding finger from the surface.
 
 @note As of v0.6.3, icedcoffee converts UIEvent and UITouch objects to ICTouchEvent and
 ICTouch objects.
