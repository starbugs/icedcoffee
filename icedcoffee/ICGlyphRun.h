/**
 @brief Represents a low-level node drawing a single glyph run
 
 The ICGlyphRun class implements a low-level node for drawing a single glyph run using a given
 font. The class attempts to minimize the number of VBOs and texture state changes required to
 display the glyphs of the run.
 
 By default, glyphs are retrieved from the current glyph cache (see ICGlyphCache) as required,
 on the fly, the first time the run is drawn. If the glyphs are not already loaded, the cache
 will load them when they are requested. Depending on the font, font size and amount of different
 characters contained in the run, glyph loading may be heavy and could lead to a decrease of your
 application's performance. If you require more control about the point in time the glyphs are
 loaded, rastered and cached, you may use the ICGlyphRun::precache method to precache all glyphs
 used by the run at a point in time of your convenience.
 
 ICGlyphRun is not designed to be used as a user interface control. Instead, it may be used to
 implement user interface controls, views or composed nodes which need to display glyph runs
 directly, without using the ICTextFrame or ICTextLine classes. If you're looking for a user
 interface control for displaying text, see the ICLabel class.
