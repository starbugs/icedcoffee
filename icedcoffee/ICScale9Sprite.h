/**
 @brief A sprite capable of scaling texture regions based on a so-called scale-9 rect
 
 This class implements a sprite consisting of 9 quads (18 polygons) that are defined by
 the sprite's size (see ICNode::size) and a scale-9 rectangle
 (see ICScale9Sprite::scale9Rect). Just as with the ICSprite class, the content size property
 defines the extends of the sprite in world coordinates (points). While the naive implementation
 of the ICSprite class simply scales or repeats its texture so that it fits the sprite's quad
 surface, ICScale9Sprite applies special scaling rules based on the specified scale-9 rectangle.
 
 The scale-9 rectangle defines an inner region of a given texture in texture coordinate space.
 The coordinates of that rectangle are defined in points. The ICScale9Sprite class uses these
 coordinates to calculate a grid like multi-quad structure which is then used to scale only
 certain parts of the texture on screen. More precisely, the corners emerging from calculating
 the intersections of the original texture rectangle and the scale-9 rectangle are not scaled
 when changing the sprite's content size while all other regions are scaled to match the final
 content size. This is essentially useful when you need to scale textures containing rounded
 corners or similar regions that must be excluded from scaling to preserve correct visual
 appearance.
