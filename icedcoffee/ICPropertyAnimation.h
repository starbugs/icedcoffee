/**
 @brief Abstract base class for property animations on nodes
 
 ICPropertyAnimation is an abstract base class implementing support for managing a property
 keypath on top of the ICAnimation superclass. The ICPropertyAnimation::keyPath property is
 thought to be used with key value coding. Subclasses should be designed to animate a single
 property defined by ICPropertyAnimation::keyPath. See the ICBasicAnimation class for an
 exemplary implementation providing basic animations on ICNode objects.
