/**
 @brief Host view controller for the Mac OS X platform
 
 ICHostViewControllerMac specializes and extends ICHostViewController to implement view management
 for the Mac OS X platform. Each Cocoa view that should display an icedcoffee scene in your
 application must have a distinct host view controller.
 
 When creating an icedcoffee-based application or integrating an icedcoffee-based OpenGL view
 into an existing Cocoa application on the Mac, it is recommended to subclass
 ICHostViewControllerMac in order to implement a specialized view controller for each
 application view that should display an icedcoffee scene.
